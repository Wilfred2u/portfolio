# My React app
Although (or because) I am a newbee to React, I thought it is important to keep up my knowledge of the platform. That's why I started this project. At first sight, it's a bunch of random JavaScript and React techniques and best practices, but as developing went on, I decided that on each topic, I had to master all the subtopics. E.g., in React, forms need useState, so I practiced useState. The whole setup uses Routes, so I dug into Routes. A very satifying way to master React. And it's not finished.
